1. # IMDB Data Visualization

2. This project analyzes and visualizes IMDB movie data using Python.

3. It covers data cleaning, exploration, and answering key analytical questions with visual insights.

4. ## Tasks Performed

5. 1. Displayed the top 10 rows of the dataset

6. 2. Displayed the last 10 rows of the dataset

7. 3. Found the shape of the dataset (rows & columns)

8. 4. Removed null/missing values and checked for duplicates

9. 5. Verified and removed duplicate values

10. ## Key Questions Explored

11. 1. Display the title of movies with runtime ≥ 180 minutes

12. 2. In which year was the highest average voting?

13. 3. In which year was the highest average revenue?

14. 4. Find the average rating for each director

15. 5. Display the top 10 longest movies (titles and runtime)

16. 6. Display the number of movies released per year

17. 7. Find the most famous movie title (highest revenue)

18. 8. Display the top 10 highest-rated movies (titles and directors)

19. 9. Does the rating of movies affect the revenue?

20. 10. Classify movies based on ratings (Excellent, Good, Average)

21. 11. Count the number of movies in the **Action** genre

22. ## Summary of Findings

23. * The dataset was cleaned by removing nulls and duplicates.

24. * Some movies have very long runtimes (≥180 minutes) and were listed separately.

25. * The years with the highest average voting and the highest average revenue were identified.

26. * Directors’ average ratings were calculated to highlight consistent performers.

27. * The longest movies and highest-rated movies were displayed with details.

28. * Annual movie production trends were visualized, showing growth in certain periods.

29. * The most famous (highest revenue) movie was identified.

30. * Ratings showed a partial positive correlation with revenue.

31. * Movies were categorized into Excellent, Good, and Average based on ratings.

32. * Genre analysis showed the total number of Action movies in the dataset.

33. ## Tools and Libraries Used

34. * Python

35. * Pandas

36. * Matplotlib / Seaborn

37. * Jupyter Notebook

38. ## How to Run

39. 1. Open **IMDB DATA VISUALIZATION (PROPER).ipynb** in Jupyter Notebook

40. 2. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations
